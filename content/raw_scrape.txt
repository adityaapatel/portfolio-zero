My first LinkedIn post and what an experience to share!

Day 2 of 
hashtag
#BostonFinTechWeek was an incredible introduction to the world of fintech conferences. As a student passionate about where finance and technology intersect, I was energized by the chance to both learn from the stage and connect in person with some of the brightest minds shaping the future.

I had the privilege of meeting:
Karan Kashyap (Posh)
Biju Kk (Fidelity Center for Applied Technology)
Evan Schnidman (Fidelity Labs)
Vijay Reddiar (Citizens Bank)
Michael Degnan (Darrery Capital)
Peter Tsahalis (Wells Fargo)
Emily O'Connor (Invisible Technologies)

And I was inspired listening to leading voices like:
Mike Massaro (CEO, Flywire)
David Jegen (F-Prime & Fintech Sandbox)
Harshul Sanghi (WillowTree Investments)
Castleigh Johnson (My Home Pathway) 

The panels touched on themes shaping the future of finance, especially
 - AI agents in banking and how automation is redefining customer experiences.
 - Stablecoins and their role in unlocking the next era of global payments.
 - Intelligent credit models, Emily O'Connor’s panel! where real-time data and AI are transforming how consumers and lenders interact. The evolution of wealthtech in an AI-driven world.

I walked away with new insights, valuable connections, and a clearer vision of what the next decade of fintech could look like: more intelligent, decentralized, and human-centered. 

Thank you to Fintech Sandbox for curating such an inspiring day. Boston truly is at the heart of fintech innovation, and I couldn’t have asked for a better first conference experience.
